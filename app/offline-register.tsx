 * Registers the offline service worker (public/sw.js) once the app has

 * responder opens a /card/* page the worker is already active and able to
 * cache it.
 *
 * Registration is skipped in development to avoid caching the hot-reload dev
 * server's responses, which would make offline behaviour confusing to test.
 * Offline support is treated as a progressive enhancement: a registration
 * failure is swallowed and never breaks the page.
